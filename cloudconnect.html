                    <h3>What is Cloud Connect?</h3>
                    <div class="detail">
                        <p>vBridge Cloud Connect is a Veeam compatible offsite storage location for the retention of
                        Veeam backup files.</p>
                        
                        <p>You must already have a compatible and licenced version of Veeam 9.5 (Backup and Recovery)
                        on your premises in order to use Cloud Connect.  vBridge does not provide support for Veeam on a
                        customer premises.</p>
                        
                        <p>You will be allocated and billed for two quotas for use of the service:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Number of virtual machines to backup.</li>
                          <li>Total size (in GB) of the committed repository for backup storage environment.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The quotas are allocated per service and are limited by availability zone.  For example, you have a Cloud Connect service in Christchurch with 2000GB quota. To use Cloud Connect in Auckland you will require a separate service. 
                        We will retain one copy of the data deposited in the Cloud Connect repository only.</p>
                        
                        <p>Ingress and egress bandwidth for your Cloud Connect service within the vBridge data centre is
                        included in the service price point.  We reserve the right to throttle bandwidth.</p>

                      <p>vBridge are able to restore customer Cloud Connect images taken of VMware hosted servers onto the vBridge IaaS platform under certain circumstances.  Any restoration or creation of IaaS resources in a DR or recovery situation is done on 
                        a time and materials and best effort basis.</p>

                      <p>For seeding of data, in some circumstances, the initial transfer of data may be too much for client Internet connectivity.  
                        Data may be seeded to vBridge in a variety of ways, including SFTP and USB drive drop off.  Time and materials charges may apply.</p>
