                      <p>vBridge  is a SMB/NFS/HDFS compatible storage location for the retention of Unstructured data files.</p>
                      <p>The platform is designed for unstructured data that is presented to customer clients and servers over a file-based protocol rather than block storage. The storage platform provides underlying erasure encoding and data protection, with the ability to replicate data to another geographically diverse location.</p>
                      <p>The customer must have private network connectivity to vBridge for access to the SMB/NFS/HDFS endpoints. Clients may reside on customer premises, while servers accessing the unstructured data endpoints must be Infrastructure as a Service hosted within the vBridge hosting platform.</p>
                      <p>You will be allocated and billed for a quota for use of the Service.</p>
                      <p>1) Total size (in TB) of the of the committed size of data in the storage environment.</p>
                      <p>The quotas are allocated per tenant and are limited by location. The unstructured data is not intended for small SME file server replacement. As such, there is a minimum commit on the platform of 10TB.</p>
                      <p>Ingress and Egress bandwidth for this service to and from client devices and servers within the vBridge data centre is included in the service price point.</p>
