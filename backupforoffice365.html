                    <div class="detail">
            
                        <p>
                            Microsoft Office 365 is the largest solution for digital collaboration
                            today. Office 365 customers can choose to connect to their on-premises
                            workloads and benefit from a seamless user experience &#8212; even when
                            moving between different environments &#8212; creating a hybrid platform.
                            Office 365 has a high adoption rate by businesses of all sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Office 365 offers an undisputed flexibility with the integration of
                            several solutions, it deeply focuses on the infrastructure management
                            rather than data management. The responsibility for data management and its
                            Availability still belongs to the respective owners leveraging the Office
                            365 services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In fact, Office 365 data centre uptime refers to the infrastructure rather
                            than data hosted in the data centres. vBridge Cloud Backup for Office 365
                            is a Veeam compatible offsite storage location for the retention of
                            Microsoft Office 365 data and files (Exchange Online, SharePoint Online,
                            OneDrive) which addresses the below scenarios:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Data loss / corruption

                                Rogue apps / insider threats

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You must already have a Microsoft Office subscription in order to use Cloud
                            Backup for Office 365. vBridge does not provide support for Microsoft
                            Office.

                        <p>1) Number of users included in the backup.</p>
                        <p>2) Total size (in GB) of the committed data within the backup storage environment, billed for and calculated on an hourly basis</p>
                        <p>We will retain one copy of the data deposited in the Cloud Backup for O365 repository only.</p>
                        <p>Ingress and egress bandwidth for your service within the vBridge data centre is included in the service price point. We reserve the right to throttle bandwidth.</p>
