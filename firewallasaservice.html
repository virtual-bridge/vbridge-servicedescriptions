                    <h3> What is Firewall as a Service?</h3>
                    <div class="detail">
            
                      <p>vBridge Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) is a Fortinet firewall offering, for the protection and security of customer hosted infrastructure and networks.</p>
<p>There are two options for of Firewall as a Service deployment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fortinet Virtual Domain (VDOM).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fortinet Virtual Machine (FortiVM).</li>
</ol>
<p>The main differences between the two are summarised below:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the VDOM solution:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The hardware platform is fully managed and maintained by vBridge. This includes the firewall operating system (FortiOS) being updated and patched.</li>
<li>b. vBridge manage and maintain the licensing and support.</li>
<li>High Availability is included in the service by utilising Cluster Active/Passive Hardware Failover managed by vBridge.</li>
<li>Network and Security functions benefit through hardware offloading to FortiASIC processors.</li>
<li>Customers have limited Administration access. For example, there is no access to network interface and routing configurations.</li>
</ol>
<li>With the VM solution</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The customer has full administrative control over the device.</li>
<li>High Availability is provided by vBridge hosting platform and occurs automatically on hardware fault.</li>
<li>vBridge provide license and support. Customer manages license installation and renewal.</li>
<li>Network connectivity (add or remove a virtual network adapter) is managed via the MyCloudSpace portal.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>You will be allocated and billed for the following.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>VDOM
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Small/Medium/Large.</li>
<li>Optional CIR Internet Bandwidth and IP address allocations</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>VM
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Cost of the size of the VM (CPU and RAM memory)</li>
<li>License for appropriate size of FortiVM</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The quotas are allocated per Service Instance. i.e. Internet bandwidth cannot be shared between multiple firewall instances.</p>

                        <p>vBridge are able to offer a VDOM to act as a routing gateway for customers with a direct cross connect or Dark Fibre Access Service (DFAS) access to vBridge. This allows high speed access to vBridge Cloud Connect Backup service by integrating with customers internal networking. The cross connect has limited access to the Cloud Connect Backup Service only and is fully managed by vBridge.</p>
